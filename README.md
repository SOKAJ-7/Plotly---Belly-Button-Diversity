# Plotly---Belly-Button-Diversity

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the microbiome of many volunteers in the search of a microbe that could potentially replicate the taste of beef. The microbiome data was stored in a JSON file and JavaScript, Plotly, Visual Studio Code, and html were used to create reponsive charts and graphs so that participants in the study could see the results for themselves.
