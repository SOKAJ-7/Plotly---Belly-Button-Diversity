# Plotly---Belly-Button-Diversity

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the microbiome of many volunteers in the search of a microbe that could potentially replicate the taste of beef. This was achieved by sampling the navel of each volunteer. The microbiome data was then stored in a JSON file so that JavaScript, Plotly, Visual Studio Code, and html could be used to create reponsive charts and graphs so that participants in the study could see the results for themselves. This includes a bar and bubble which shows which bacterial species are most common in their navel as well as a gauge chart showing the washing frequency of the participants navel. These charts can be seen below for volunteer 940:
